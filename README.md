# Tesla dashboard for beamng drive

## So I decided to made my first dashboard for beamng drive. This is in an early stage so isn't what the final version gonna look like.

### To do:
- [x] Speedometer
- [x] Blinkers
- [X] Music (now is showing the music name, and controls work)
- [ ] RPM (i'll make more good looking in the future)
- [x] Low fuel warning
- [ ] Car Settings (WIP)
- [ ] Fan Settings (for instance is not functional)
- [ ] Map (i'm looking a way to implement it, for instance it's not working)
- [x] Fuel remaining

This version only displays the essentials and is a proof of concept.

> If I see support I will add more features and anything you want (if I can)
