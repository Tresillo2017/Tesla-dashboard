# Tesla dashboard for beamng drive

## So I decided to made my first dashboard for beamng drive. This is in an early stage so isn't what the final version gonna look like.

### To do:
[x] Speedometer
[x] Blinkers
[] Music (i'm gonna add later music control and volume)
[] RPM (i'll make more good looking in the future)
[x] Low fuel warning
[] Car Settings (WIP)
[] Fan Settings (for instance is not functional)
[] Map (is the ET2 map since beamng drive don't support it)
[x] Fuel remaining

This version only displays the essentials and is a proof of concept.

> If I see support I will add more features and anything you want (if I can)
